# signal-bot

https://signal-bot.github.io

This project is in its infancy!

## The idea

* signal-bot provides headless chat/bot/monitoring services for the [Signal][signal] messenger.
* Services are made available via plugins.
* Writing new plugins to extend functionality is easy and modular since signal-bot smoothly wraps around [signal-cli][signal-cli] in order to provide a convenient Python framework.

## To do

* finish mocker to support "message protocol" testing, i.e. testing whether certain messages are responded to as expected by signalbot; also allow for easy definition of such test cases/conversations
* lay out the core signal-bot message triager and the plugin interface
* setup.py that also deals with python-gi, which is not smoothly installable via pip; for travis one way may be to symlink the dist-packages

## Mocker (work in progress)

The idea behind `Mocker` is to enable for testing and debugging of signal-bot and its plugins.
It offers a dbus service that (partially) mimicks the dbus service of signal-cli (if needed, it should eventually mimick the [signal-cli dbus service interface][signal-dbus] exactly).

```python
from pydbus import SessionBus
from signalclidbusmock import Mocker
from threading import Thread
import time

# start dummy dbus service
mocker = Mocker()


# a minimalistic signal-bot
def message(t, s, g, m, a):
    t = Thread(target=signal.sendMessage,
               args=['Hello {}, this is Signalbot :-)'.format(s), None, [s]],
               daemon=True)
    t.start()


bus = SessionBus()
signal = bus.get('org.signalbot.signalclidbusmock')
signal.onMessageReceived = message

# simulate sending messages to signal-bot
mocker.messageSignalbot('+123', None, 'Hi signal-bot!', [])
mocker.messageSignalbot('+000', None, 'Who are you?', [])

# wait for signal-bot to respond
time.sleep(1)

# the messages we sent to signal-bot
print(mocker.tosignalbot)

# the messages signal-bot sent in response
print(mocker.fromsignalbot)
```
